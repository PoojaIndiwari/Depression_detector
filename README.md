#  Student Depression â€“ Data Preprocessing & EDA

This repository contains our *Group Submission* for *Progress Review I: Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* as part of the IT2011 coursework.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The aim of this project is to demonstrate *data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA* techniques on the *Student Depression dataset*.  
Each group member handled one preprocessing technique, explained why it was needed, implemented it with code, and presented at least one EDA visualization.

The final deliverable includes:
- Six individual notebooks (one per member)  
- One integrated *group pipeline notebook* combining all steps  
- Organized outputs (plots, processed datasets, logs)  
*Guidelines and format follow the Progress Review I brief.*
